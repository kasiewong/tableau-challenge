Observations of Citi Bike Ridership Data from July - December 2019

1) Most riders are subscribers who have purchased an annual pass. 
Over the last six months of 2019, riders have slowly encompassed more of the total ridership percentage (ie. ~80% to 90%)

2) The vast majority of Citi Bike riders are male. Men encompass 65%+ of total ridership. 
The gender imbalance is slowly widening from July to December, with more men and fewer women riding towards the end of the year.
It might be helpful to launch a marketing campaign to target new female ridership.

3) Most riders are young commuters between the ages of 23-40. One notable exception is age 50. 
50 year olds make up 8.5% of total ridership alone. 
If Citi Bike can maintain ridership loyalty in 50 year olds, it would be extremely profitable. 

4) One noteable statistic of interest is that the top two start stations are also the top two end stations. 
Marketing should increase the number of bikes at both of these stations. Broadway & E 22 St. and E 17 & Broadway.
